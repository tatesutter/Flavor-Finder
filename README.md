# Getting Started with Flavor-Finder
WHEN users input and submit unique login information at the opening page
THEN they can access the project in an account unique to that person
WHEN users ask to view a recipe
THEN the website will select a single recipe at random to show to the user, pulled by the API
WHEN users choose to store a recipe of their choosing
THEN they can input the name, baking items, and instructions of that recipe for the SQL database to store
WHEN users want to search for only recipes that have or don't have specific ingredients
THEN they can select boxes to filter out recipes without those ingredients, and the display will be changed accordingly


# You will need:

1. Two different APIs

2. Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database

3. Create PPTX or a Presentation File

4. Be interactive and responsive

5. A polished UI

6. React for the front end

7. A folder structure that follows separation of concerns (design principle for neatly organizing a computer program by separating it into different sections).
