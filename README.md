# Getting Started with Flavor-Finder
WHEN users input and submit unique login information at the opening page

THEN they can access the project in an account unique to that person

WHEN users find the website before logging in

THEN they will see in the header: buttons letting them view specific displays in the body based on which one is activated: Recipes (several boxes with a finished dish, the name of the dish, and recipe instructions for it), Profile (profile information, including how many recipes they've saved once on their account), Login (user input for logging into an already existing account), and Signup (user input for making a new account).

WHEN users ask to view a recipe

THEN the website will select a single recipe at random to show to the user, pulled by the API

WHEN users choose to store a recipe of their choosing

THEN they can input the name, baking items, and instructions of that recipe for the SQL database to store

WHEN users want to search for only recipes that have or don't have specific ingredients

THEN they can select boxes to filter out recipes without those ingredients, and the display will be changed accordingly

WHEN a specific recipe is selected and displayed

THEN the webpage will display in descending order: an image of the finished dish, the dish's title, recipe instructions for how to make the dish, a button titled "Watch on YouTube" linking to a video on how to make the dish, and a "Save Recipe" button allowing users to save the recipe to their account.



# You will need:

1. Two different APIs

2. Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database

3. Create PPTX or a Presentation File

4. Be interactive and responsive

5. A polished UI

6. React for the front end

7. A folder structure that follows separation of concerns (design principle for neatly organizing a computer program by separating it into different sections).
