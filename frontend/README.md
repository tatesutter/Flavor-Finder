# Getting Started with Flavor-Finder
This project will:

1. Give users the ability to input their preferences (ex. If a user doesn't like tomatoes, then they can indicate to pull a random recipe that doesn't include tomatoes).

2. Ask users to input login information that allows for them to interact with the project independantly from each other.

3. Provide users a randomized recipe--pulled via the API--to make.

4. Let users store recipes that they enjoyed and want to make again. These recipes should be stored in a database in SQL.

5. Allow users to look up recipes using the ingredients they currently have (ex. If a user has eggs, sugar and pickled beets, then they can input those ingredients for the database to scan; the database will then display recipes that include each of those ingredients).

6. Contain an SQL database with tables, and the values inside are different recipes (recipe names, ingredients, etc).


# You will need:

1. Two different APIs

2. Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database

3. Create PPTX or a Presentation File

4. Be interactive and responsive

5. A polished UI

6. React for the front end

7. A folder structure that follows separation of concerns (design principle for neatly organizing a computer program by separating it into different sections).
